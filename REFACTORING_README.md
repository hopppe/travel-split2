# Travel Split App Refactoring

## Overview

This refactoring project aims to improve the codebase structure by breaking down the large `TripDetailView.swift` file (over 1600 lines) into smaller, more focused components. This approach follows best practices for SwiftUI development and makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure

Created a new directory structure for better organization:

```
travel split/Views/TripDetail/
├── TripDetailView.swift           # Main container view
├── ExpensesViews.swift            # Expenses-related views
├── BalancesViews.swift            # Balances-related views
├── ParticipantsViews.swift        # Participants-related views
├── Components/
│   ├── TabControlView.swift       # Tab control components
│   └── SharedComponents.swift     # Reusable UI components
├── ExpenseSheets/
│   ├── AddExpenseSheet.swift      # Add expense sheet
│   └── EditExpenseSheet.swift     # Edit expense sheet
└── ParticipantSheets/
    └── AddParticipantSheet.swift  # Add participant sheet
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Modular Components**: Each file now has a specific responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Reduced File Size**: Individual files are now under 200 lines, following best practices for code organization.

3. **Reusable Components**: Created shared components that can be reused across the app, reducing code duplication.

4. **Improved Readability**: Each component is now more focused and easier to understand.

5. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one feature are less likely to affect others.

6. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, more focused components are easier to test in isolation.

### Bug Fixes

During the refactoring, we also addressed several bugs:

1. **Custom Split Amounts**: Fixed an issue where custom split amounts were being reset when editing an expense.

2. **Visual Feedback**: Added visual feedback when editing participant amounts in the expense sheets.

3. **Currency Symbol**: Made the currency symbol clickable in the expense sheets.

## How to Update Your Project

To incorporate these changes into your Xcode project:

1. Right-click on the 'Views' group in the project navigator
2. Select 'Add Files to "travel split"...'
3. Navigate to and select the 'TripDetail' folder
4. Make sure 'Create groups' is selected and click 'Add'
5. Build and run the project

## Next Steps

After this refactoring, consider:

1. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for the new components.
2. **UI Tests**: Add UI tests for the main user flows.
3. **Documentation**: Add more inline documentation to explain complex logic.
4. **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility features throughout the app.

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase structure without changing the app's functionality. The modular approach will make future development easier and more efficient.
